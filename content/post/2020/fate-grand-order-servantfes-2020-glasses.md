It's the third installment in our [accidental series](https://rubenerd.com/tag/servantfes-2020/ "View all posts tagged with ServantFes 2020") exploring the *Servant Summerâ˜…Festival 2020* event in everyone's favourite mobile game, [Fate/Grand Order](https://fate-go.us). It's the only mobile game I've ever been able to get into, most likely due to already being a *Fate* universe fan, and having an advanced predisposition to collectable card games.

So far we've seen Jeanne Alter's fear of [dolphins](https://rubenerd.com/fate-grand-order-servantfes-2020-dolphins/) and [nicknames](https://rubenerd.com/fate-grand-order-servantfes-2020-dialogue/). Today she confronts non-Alter Jeanne&mdash;this gets confusing sometimes&mdash;in a typical, overly-heated exchange about speculation equipment:

I thought Clara's glasses were *extremely* cute when I first met her; not that I'd admit publicly to that preference, or take screenshots from a summer event in a mobile game that also implied as such.

By contrast, have I mentioned just how bone-chillingly cold it's been in Sydney in the last few days?! Tasmania has even had snow. Part of me wishes I was in working-from-home COVID mode in Cairns just so I could return to a semblence of my [native habitat](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Singapore#Climate "Wikipedia article on Singapore's climate").
