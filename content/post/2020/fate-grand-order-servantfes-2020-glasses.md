It's the [third installment](https://rubenerd.com/tag/servantfes-2020/) in our ongoing, accidental blog post series exploring the *Servant Summer★Festival 2020* event in everyone's favourite mobile game, [Fate/Grand Order](https://fate-go.us). Today Jeanne Alter confronts Jeanne non-Alter in a heated exchange that's so <del>un</del>like her.

I thought Clara was *extremely* cute when I first met her, and her glasses most definitely added to it. Not that I'd admit publicly to that preference.
