From his 1996 book *The Demon-Haunted World: Science as a Candle in the Dark*, emphasis added:

> The dumbing down of America is most evident in the slow decay of substantive content in the enormously influential media, the 30 second sound bites (now down to 10 seconds or less), lowest common denominator programming, credulous presentations on pseudoscience and superstition, but **especially a kind of celebration of ignorance**.

The US suffers from the worst case of this, whether it be mask protests, 5G paranioa, lies about vaccines, or the moon not being made of cheese, but they're by no means unique. See my [other post today on intentions](https://bryan-hughes-on-intentions/).
