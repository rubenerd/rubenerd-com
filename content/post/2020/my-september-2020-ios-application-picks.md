* The **[Equinix Customer Portal](https://apps.apple.com/au/app/equinix-customer-portal/id571598183)** is much handier than futzing around in your email or using their mobile site to get data centre access.

* Ghost doesn't have an official blog posting app for iOS, but **[Publisher for Ghost](https://apps.apple.com/au/app/ghost-publisher/id1509389003)** is as good as one for the people I host other blogs for.

* **[HE.NET Network Tools](https://apps.apple.com/au/app/he-net-network-tools/id858241710)** has ARP, Bonjour, DNS, iperf, ping, portscans, traceroute, whois, TLS, and more in a polished interface. I'd expect nothing less from the engineers behind [Looking Glass](http://lg.he.net/).<p></p>

* I never thought I'd never see **[NetNewsWire](https://apps.apple.com/au/app/netnewswire-rss-reader/id1480640210)** for iOS, but it's great to have my favourite Mac RSS reader from back in the day on my portable telephonic device. I just need to figure out if/how I can sync it with TinyTinyRSS on my FreeBSD cloud server.

* The replacement **[Nikkei Asian Review](https://apps.apple.com/au/app/nikkei-asian-review/id1515887675)** application is infinitely better than the old one. Just log in with your subscriber details.
