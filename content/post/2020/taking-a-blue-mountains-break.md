I realised I [posted on Twitter](https://twitter.com/Rubenerd/status/1284095888198008834) about our annual leave, but not here where it's far more important! Above is an unedited photo I took during one of Clara's and my bush walks in the [Blue Mountains National Park](https://www.nationalparks.nsw.gov.au/visit-a-park/parks/blue-mountains-national-park) near Katoomba and Leura.

See you all next week.
