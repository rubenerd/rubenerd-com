*(Update: The permalink for this post indicates the original title of <strong>pirates</strong> instead <strong>blogging</strong>. I would have posted another dozen entries for this event, but I figured you were all getting sick of it by now! So I ended it here with something a little more meta).*

It's the sixth, and final installment in our [accidental series](https://rubenerd.com/tag/servantfes-2020/ "View all posts tagged with ServantFes 2020") exploring the *Servant Summer★Festival 2020* event in everyone's favourite mobile game, *[Fate/Grand Order](https://fate-go.us)*. So far Blackbeard has discussed [taking sides](https://rubenerd.com/fate-grand-order-servantfes-2020-both-sides/), and Jeanne Alter professed fear of [data loss](https://rubenerd.com/fate-grand-order-servantfes-2020-backups/) [glasses](https://rubenerd.com/fate-grand-order-servantfes-2020-glasses/), [dolphins](https://rubenerd.com/fate-grand-order-servantfes-2020-dolphins/) and [nicknames](https://rubenerd.com/fate-grand-order-servantfes-2020-dialogue/).

Today Jeanne Alter sees us off by answering how she and I have managed to blog over the years.

And better yet, both Jeanne Alter and Robin Hood praised my blog for being the best they'd ever read.

But, oh well. Hey, a porridge stand." style="width:500px; height:281px;" /></p>

Porridge? Oats?! *The world's most perfect food!?* That reminds me, I need to blog about oats, grilled cheese sandwiches, and coffee again. The last time I mentioned two of these was [back in San Francisco in 2018](https://rubenerd.com/cafe-reveille-and-oatly/).

Thanks to Type-Moon, Aniplex, DELiGHTWORKS, and the whole [Fate/Grand Order](https://fate-go.us/) team for such a fun game over the last few weeks. It's been just what Clara and I needed.
