I've been having recurring headaches again the last few weeks, culminating with some head-swimming migraines. So Clara and I decided to take advantage of the nice winter weather and go for a long walk down from Chatswood into the city.

The sky was a gorgeous deep blue from the Sydney Harbour Bridge, and I always love watching the water taxis and ferries zip across the water from up on the deck. I rarely appreciate the view when I'm on a commuter train travelling across the bridge on the other side.

As we started to head back late in the afternoon, some of the most dramatic clouds we've seen in a long time started sweeping across the harbour from the east. Have I mentioned how much I love my tiny new Ricoh GR III?!

I'm back home nursing another headache, but today was lovely.
