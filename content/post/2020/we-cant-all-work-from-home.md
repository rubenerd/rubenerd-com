I've written a few times about working from home since COVID hit, including how bosses [handle remote work](https://rubenerd.com/remote-work-as-a-platform/) better than others, that Australian Internet can [be a challenge](https://rubenerd.com/working-from-home-still-tenuous-sometimes/), and both the mental and physical [health concerns](https://rubenerd.com/sleep-patterns-and-home-isolation/) from being more sedentary.

But it took an Apple commentator tweeting how great it is that we can "all" work from home, and double-down with insults when asked about it, that made me appreciate how blinkered I've also been by the experience.

I'll go out on a limb here and say *most* people can't work from home. Worse, millions have to make brutal decisions to go to work during a pandemic that could impact the health of their families. Remote work, like so much of our modern economy, disproportionately favours the middle class in white-collar jobs. And, dare I say it, it has come to depend on the so-called *gig economy* which further stratifies society into the haves and have nots.

The whole thing reminded me of [defending tipping culture](https://rubenerd.com/tipping-culture/), or another Twitterer saying back in March&mdash;without a trace of irony&mdash;that food delivery meant nobody needed to leave home. I... wait, what?! It all demonstrates the same disconnection from people struggling in the real world,  and I realise I'm just as guilty of it.

It also highlights the need for more social security. I say as a taxpayer, someone who donates a chunk of his income each month to medical research and charities, and who'd continue to work after its introduction: we need universal basic income. My heart goes out to people doing it tough right now, but individual actions and good will aren't sufficient. I'd also expect to see a shakeup in the labour market when certain employers realise they can't threaten people with destitution.
