We've got another palindromic date, if one were to write it without dashes. It even works across multiple formats:

* The correct ISO 8601 convention as `YYYY-MM-DD`
* The logically ordered but still incorrect `DD-MM-YYYY`
* The illogically ordered and entirely incorrect `MM-DD-YYYY`

People who don't use the ISO format are as bad as those who don't use leading zeros on their dates and times. You know who you are.

I also discovered the Dashboard.app still exists, which I used to highlight the fact I took a screenshot at `20:02`, which is also a palindrome. That's also the correct way to write digital time, none of this ambiguous and verbose AM/PM nonsense!

I've told the story a few times, but I remember an Australian primary school teacher showing us a mnemonic for remembering AM and PM: AM is for *After Midnight* and PM is *Past Midday*. I scratched my head the whole walk home, wondering why it wasn't *After Midday* and *Past Midnight* in that same system. And isn't the evening technically still *after* midnight on that day?

AM/PM need to be relegated to the litter basket of history, along with the various incompatible Imperial systems, non-ISO dates, and [coriander](https://www.nature.com/news/soapy-taste-of-coriander-linked-to-genetic-variants-1.11398).
