Wait, haven't we had this song for a [Music Monday](https://rubenerd.com/tag/music-monday/ "All posts tagged with Music Monday") already? We sure have, [back in 2018](https://rubenerd.com/music-monday-book-end-happy-end/ "Music Monday: Book-end, Happy-end")\:

> Everything about this is perfect. I loved the visual imagery, the shots of all the vintage electronic gear they’re using, the endless shots of Tokyo. I badly want to get back there as soon as humanly possible!

Back then, we couldn't travel for lack of time. Now that we all physically can't, let's take the imagery instead.

For those who didn't see it last time, this is the TECHNOBOYS PULCRAFT GREEN-FUND, with Hiroshi Takano (centre-right above) providing his unique vocals.
