Every now and then I press Wikipedia's [Random Article](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:Random) link, and came across an article about this [northern area of Germany](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Holstein_Switzerland)\:

> Holstein Switzerland (German: Holsteinische Schweiz) is a hilly area with a patchwork of lakes and forest in Schleswig Holstein, Germany, reminiscent of Swiss landscape. Its highest point is the Bungsberg (168 metres above sea level). It is a designated nature park as well as an important tourist destination in Northern Germany situated between the cities of Kiel and LÃ¼beck.

Regarding the name: 

> [...] goes back to the 19th century when holidaying in Switzerland was particularly popular amongst the well-to-do. As a consequence, other regions strove to add the name "Switzerland" to their description. 

There are some gorgeous landscape photos on the article, but I especially liked the composition of the one below by [Oliver Raupach in 2007](https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Dieksee_Blick.jpg). I wonder what the woman on the right is looking at?
