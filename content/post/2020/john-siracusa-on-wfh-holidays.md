> **John:** Looking forward to my *vay-cay-tion* ♫

> **Merlin:** *Vay-cay-tion!* ♫ Will you go somewhere?    
>
> **John:** I will not. [ed: sounds like he's smiling]
>
> **Merlin:** Oh. You get to be at home and not work, basically.    
>
> **John:** ... not only because of WWDC, but I'm also looking forward to not having to "go to work". Because you'd think, oh well, would you even notice, because you're just in the same place all the time? And the answer is: yes.
