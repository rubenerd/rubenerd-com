Ram > Rem, and not just because Rie Murakawa voices her! [Via @kyoajin](https://twitter.com/kyoajin/status/1274149732479315968).

I finally got around to watching the whole first season during my morning commute last year, but never got around to reviewing it. There were aspects I shamelessly enjoyed, though one of the repeating plot devices did got old, and the gore was a bit much. One day I'll actually review it here properly. 3/5?
