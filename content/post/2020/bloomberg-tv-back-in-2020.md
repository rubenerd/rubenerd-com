I didn't know you could watch [Bloomberg TV live](https://www.bloomberg.com/live) for free online. The information-dense screen was a staple of so many buildings in Singapore growing up in the 1990sâ€“00s, so it was nostalgic to see back in our little Sydney apartment.

Then I saw a 30-second long advert on how to wash your hands, and I was brought back to the present.
