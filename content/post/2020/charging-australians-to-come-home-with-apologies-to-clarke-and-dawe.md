**Brian:** Senator Geneva, thanks for joining us.

> **Geneva:** It's a great pleasure, thank you.

**Brian:** This $3,000 tax you're levying against Australian citizens returning home for screening and quarantine&mdash;

> **Geneva:** Now Brian, let me be clear, this is not a tax. It's a contribution to offset the cost of their returning home from overseas.

**Brian:** But what if they can't afford it?

> **Geneva:** Brian, everyone who travels is a rich expat or jetsetter who pays no Australian taxes.

**Brian:** Like Rupert Murdoch?

> **Geneva:** Not at all Brian, he's an American citizen now.

**Brian:** I see. Back to affordability, are you saying citizenship is now means tested?

> **Geneva:** No Brian that's an absurd statement. People are just asked to pay for the cost of their repatriation.

**Brian:** And otherwise, they're stuck overseas? How does that fulfil our obligations under international law?

> **Geneva:** Look Brian, it's perfectly inline with our international obligations. They're free to return, where upon they'll be sent to an Australian prison. *In Australia*. It's an Australian prison, Brian.

**Brian:** You don't see an ethical problem with that?

> **Geneva:** I don't Brian, it's better treatment than what we give refugees we're responsible for under the same international treaties. These people had *months* to return home, and they chose not to&mdash;

**Brian:** By not being allowed to leave by a foreign government? Or because of family or employment reasons?

> **Geneva:** Exactly. It was a choice, by those overseas officials to close their borders. Or the bosses of those Australians. Or reasons outside their control. It's called personal responsibility, Brian.

**Brian:** So Senator Geneva, what was the alternative? Everyone returning at once? You saw how we handled a single cruise ship arriving back in Sydney.

> **Geneva:** Well yes we've learned a lot. It's an evolving threat, I'm the first to admit this Brian, the first to admit this.

**Brian:** We clearly haven't learned a lot, with the latest news out of Victoria and New South Wales.

> **Geneva:** All the more reason to prevent citizens coming home then under the guise of fiscal responsibility, Brian.

**Brian:** [shakes head] Senator Geneva, thanks for your time. When will you be returning home?

> **Geneva:** Thank you Brian. I'll still be here until my crowdfunding page gets to $3,000.

**Brian:** You can't afford to return home?

> **Geneva:** No, I work for the ABC.
