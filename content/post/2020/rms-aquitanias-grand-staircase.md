I love going on Wikipedia and seeing new photos pop up of old ocean liners I obsessed over as a kid. Below we have the top landing of the RMS *Aquitania's* Grand Staircase, uploaded by the <a href="https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Grand_Entrance_on_the_%27Aquitania%27_(1914)_RMG_G10898.tiff">Royal Museums Greenwich</a>:

Compare this design to the [dramatic Grand Staircase](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grand_Staircase_of_the_RMS_Titanic) on the *Olympic*-class ships of the time that are mounted against the far wall, as everyone would recognise now thanks to the *Titanic* movie. On those vessels the stairs start symmetrically from either side and fan out to the floor below, as opposed to spiraling down a stairwell. *Aquitania's* looks understated by comparison and, dare I say, I might prefer it.

The RMS *Aquitania* was built by Cunard in response to White Star's *Olympic*-class ships that were slower, but bigger and more luxurious than their Blue Riband-holding *Lusitania* and *Mauretania*. Those ships had a similar staircase to *Aquitania*, but integrated a lift in the interior space around the stairwell. 
She was launched in 1914, and saw service in both World Wars.

I always thought *Aquitania* had a fascinating design; as if the *Lusitania* had been scaled up to *Olympic's* size with clear design elements from both. I might write a post about that at some point.
