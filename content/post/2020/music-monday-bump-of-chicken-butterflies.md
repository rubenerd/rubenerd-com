Bump of Chicken has been one of my new favourites since their 2014 *Ray* album. Most of my favourite music is jazz, but I also have a soft spot for bands like this. There's a specific quality about their voices and the way they let the syths melt into their music that I absolutely love, not to mention all the beautiful visuals.

This is the eponymous song from their 2016 album *Butterfly*. I don't even like big concerts, but I'd fly with Clara to Japan if we could see them perform it live.
