The English version of everyone's [favourite mobile game](https://fate-go.us/) just [turned three](https://fate-go.us/3rd_anniversary/), so to celebrate we get our pick of two anniversary craft essences. Mashu got me into the game in the first place, she's still my favourite, and I'm an unconscionable sucker for hats! So hers was an obvious choice.

<p><img src="https://rubenerd.com/files/2020/fgo-3rd-mashu@1x.jpg" srcset="https://rubenerd.com/files/2020/fgo-3rd-mashu@1x.jpg 1x, https://rubenerd.com/files/2020/fgo-3rd-mashu@2x.jpg 2x" alt="Mashu craft essence" style="width:500px; height:333px;" /></p>

The second is trickier. Umu is my other favourite in the game and is drawn by Clara's and my favourite artist [Wadarco](), but Saber Alter has a coffee cup.

But it gets worse. Clara has this exact art from Tamamo's CE in her weeb cabinet, and we agree she's probably the cutest of them all. Or I could make myself feel better having not summoned Merlin during the guaranteed summon **yet again** and get his.

I would class this a *real* world problem.
