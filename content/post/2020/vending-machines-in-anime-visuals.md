The Western press predictably make a big deal out of the obscure and perverted when talking about Japanese vending machines, but standard drink fare apparatuses&mdash;apparatii?&mdash;are indispensable. Sorry, couldn't resist. They really are ubiquitous, and usually have a thoughtfully places recycling bin along side them. A disproportionate number of Clara's and my favourite Japanese holiday memories include them somehow, which I wouldn't have expected. I should write a proper post about that.

I was going through a backup folder from 2014 and saw this key visual from *Wake Up, Girls!*, an anime series from the time. The vending machine behind Okamoto Miyu looks like it's stocked with cans of a beverage nature, but the light box ad that's a staple of these machines is advertising some ice cream confectionery product.

I want to go back to ÅŒsaka and have our [cute boy coffee and tea](https://www.chichiyasu.com/ "Chichiyasu"). One day I hope.
