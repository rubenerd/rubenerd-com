Just over a year ago we [said goodbye](https://rubenerd.com/goodbye-again-to-the-linux-journal/ "Goodbye again to the Linux Journal") to one of the magazines that informed so much of my childhood and early career. Their coverage of the BSDs and other \*nix OSs were also hugely useful, and helped get Beastie on magazine shelves in bookstores.

They've been [rebooted by Slashdot Media](https://www.linuxjournal.com/content/linux-journal-back), and are soliciting feedback and past writers to get involved. I already read [Doc Searls' blog](https://blogs.harvard.edu/doc/) daily, but would love to see his name appear in articles again.

Give us a subscription link, and I'll damn well pay for it too!
