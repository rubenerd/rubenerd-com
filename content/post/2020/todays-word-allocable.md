I learned a new word today from a spelling suggestion. Here's the definition from [WordNet](http://wordnetweb.princeton.edu/perl/webwn?s=allocable&sub=Search+WordNet), which is still up:

> S (adj) **allocable**. (capable of being distributed)

I've been using *allocatable* in all my technical documentation since I started my career. I'm torn; *allocable* is succinct and can be found in more dictionaries, but *allocatable* sounds closer to *allocate*, which renders the language more approachable. Or is it *appropable?*

Which do you think is better? [Let me know](https://rubenerd.com/about/#contact).
