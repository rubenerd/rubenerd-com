Yesterday I brought up *audio magazine* as one of the early alternative terms to podcasting. Jim Kloss from the late [Whole Wheat Radio](https://rubenerd.com/tag/whole-wheat-radio/) had some [feedback](https://twitter.com/JKloss4/status/1292081225335742464)\:

> I liked 'audio magazine' better too - that's the term I coined rather than 'internet magazine'  - just sayin'.  :-) And while the original 'audio magazine' wikipedia page no longer exists, there is a nod to [that page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Audio_magazine).

I think *audio magazine* was my first ever Wikipedia page, from October 2005. You can see my [original version](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Audio_magazine&oldid=25721158) in the Wikipedia edit archive, with all its spelling mistakes and run-on sentences:

> Coined by Jim Kloss of Whole Wheat Radio, Audio Magazine is a proposed alternative phrase for podcasting. The term podcasting has recieved criticism in that it is misleading as it infers that the technology is only usable on Apple Computer's proprietery MP3 player: the iPod; this argument has intensified since the launch of embedded podcasting support in iTunes. In reality virtually any RSS enabled devices with audio output capabilities can make use of podcasts, whether they be computers, MP3 players or other devices.

With hindsight I can see why didn't match Wikipedia's editing style or reference requirements. But fortunately unlike my equivalent one on New Time Radio, the admins converted this one into a disambiguation page. I'm still the last person to have edited it, back when I overhauled the [Whole Wheat Radio](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Whole_Wheat_Radio) article to rescue it from a specific Wikipedia admin who's likeness should grace dictionary pages alongside the phrase "bad faith".

I refer to my own silly show as a podcast now because people know what those are and how to use them. But as my own small act of defiance I've also tagged every show as an [audio magazine](https://rubenerd.com/tag/audio-magazine/) from the very beginning, for what little search-engine juice it's worth :).

Jim also raises another point that I've had a draft post about for more than a couple of years; perhaps his observation will get me off my proverbial arse and finish it!
