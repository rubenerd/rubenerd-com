Clara and I went for a wander around Neutral Bay and North Sydney again yesterday, and found the [Forsyth Park](https://www.northsydney.nsw.gov.au/Recreation_Facilities/Sports_Sportsgrounds/Sportsgrounds/Forsyth_Park). It's a beautiful little urban forest which opens out to a cricket pitch and children's playground on the south side. 

I liked that we were able to see a brush turkey, and the city in the distance :).
