Even as an angmoh I was concerned. The unwashed rice was the cardinal sin for me though... *wah lao eh!*

I learned to cook rice from a local friend's mum when we were growing up in Singapore. And yes, I did the metal spoon on the pan thing too; fortunately she were gracious enough about it to forgive me. Thank you auntie :).
