Leith van Onselen [wrote this for Macrobusiness](https://www.macrobusiness.com.au/2020/08/nbn-is-already-obsolete/ "NBN is already obsoletete") about Australia's National Broadband Network:

All of us in the industry warned about this, *from the start*. No politician can feign ignorance without lying to taxpayers.

Isn't that short-sighted politics in a nutshell? Sacrifice $100 in the future for $10 today.

And upgradeability. Change the optics on either side of the cable, and you can take advantage of technological advances with minimal extra investment. We've [known about this](https://rubenerd.com/annexe-fibre-optic-considered-faster-than-copper/) for decades.

This was all 1) known, and 2) warned about when Malcolm Turnbull first proposed his economically and technologically-flawed *multi-technology mix*. This is pure, uncut politics.

Now that everything we said has come true, can we *please* do it right this time?
