The 29th of February is always a delightful date, even if it does throw my budgets off by a day. These are the posts that have appeared on Leap Days, in descending order of datage. *Datage?*

* **2020:** [Rubenerd Show 404: The 29th griddle episode](https://rubenerd.com/show404/) (yesterday)
* **2016:** [Rubenerd Show 326: The 29th of February episode](https://rubenerd.com/show326/)
* **2012:** *none!*
* **2008:** [Is embedded spam getting worse?](https://rubenerd.com/is-embedded-spam-getting-worse/)
* **2004:** *none!*

I well and truly messed up what was a nice cadence of off/on again posts by uploading a show yesterday. I should have waited until 2024.

The only thing I remember from Leap Day 2012 was getting my Wikipedia username officially changed to RubenSchade, because I wanted to be more transparent with my edits.
