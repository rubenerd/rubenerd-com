[Melissa Davey quoted](https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2020/jul/27/coronavirus-australia-victoria-reports-record-532-new-cases-and-six-deaths-as-nsw-reports-17-cases) the Premier of Victoria at his press conference yesterday:

> He added that some people were feeling shame around their symptoms and positive diagnosis, causing them to delay telling close contacts for fear of being judged. "I had a bit of feedback from people that there might be some reticence to come forward" he said.
> 
> "There might be a sense that you would be looked upon badly, that you would be somehow judged, that you would be not necessarily seen as doing the right thing – nothing could be further from the truth. If you have symptoms, coming forward and getting tested, it will be something we’ll be grateful for and it's you making a powerful contribution and doing the right thing."
