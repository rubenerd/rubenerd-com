Via [Elisabeth Law](https://twitter.com/ElawReads/status/1289223802044456960) on Twitter. I immediately responded with Blues Brothers because I haven't seen any movie more times.

* Air Force One\*
* The Aviator
* Blues Brothers
* The Castle
* The Holy Grail
* The K-On! Movie
* Mr Vampire
* The Shawshank Redemption
* Shawn of the Dead
* Serenity
* Star Trek IV: The Voyage Home
* Star Trek: First Contact
* WALL•E

Even though I thought it was a so-so movie, I've probably *cumulatively* seen Air Force One five times. It was my first VCD in Singapore, and I used its DAT files to experiment with different encoders, etc. If only my lowly Pentium 1 machine somehow had a LaserDisc player, the quality on that was significantly better.
