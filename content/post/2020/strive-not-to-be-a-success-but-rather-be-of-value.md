I saw the title of this post whiz by as a quote on Twitter. I was about ready to say that they need not be mutually exclusive. Success could be defined by the value you place in yourself, those around you, and what you provide. In which case, is a phrase with three words.

Then I realised it was [Albert Einstein](https://quoteinvestigator.com/2017/11/20/value/). I defer to his expertise!

I took the above photo last weekend at The Rocks in Sydney, and desaturated it to add to the strangeness of the scene. Despite outward appearances of being related to this post, it's in fact a non-sequitur.
