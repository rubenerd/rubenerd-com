The above photo in Ponto-chō was taken by [Mstyslav Chernov](https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Narrow_streets_of_historical_part_of_Kyoto_decorated_with_all_kinds_of_traditional_japanese_lanterns_at_a_rainy_city_night.jpg) in 2010. Kyoto is my favourite place in the world; one day I hope we can all travel again.

Setting up a self-hosted photo sharing site may also be a way to help alleviate cabin fever, now that I think about it. I'm trying to consolidate everything into just a single replicated PostgreSQL install, but all the good photo sharing and hosting packages run on MariaDB. I'll need to do some digging.
