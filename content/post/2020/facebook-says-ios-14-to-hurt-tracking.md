Salvador Rodriguez [reported some good news in CNBC](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/07/30/facebook-says-apples-ios-14-changes-could-hurt-its-ad-targeting.html) last Thursday:

> Facebook Chief Financial Officer David Wehner said on Thursday that upcoming changes to Apple’s iOS 14 operating system could hurt the social network’s ability to target ads to users. 
> 
> With the update to its mobile devices, Apple will ask users if they want to let app developers track their activity across other apps and websites. Apple has not said when iOS 14 will launch, but it’s expected to roll out this year.

I'll be interested to see how Android will respond to this, if at all. It's traditionally lagged behind the industry along with Chrome, for obvious reasons. It's interesting, and perhaps a bit sad, that so many of my purchasing and IT decisions are made based on something being *less bad* than something else on a metric I care about.

FreeBSD and NetBSD are probably the only platforms I use now because I enjoy them.
