Trademark disputes and confusion have exited since they have; a tautological statement for which I couldn't resist. But in the spirit of realising when I've been previously wrong about something, I'm here to explore the idea that there may be something to trademark antsiness in tech after all.

The term *podcast* was my first experience with this. Everyone I knew and respected in the tech and online media communities couldn't stand the phrase when it came out in the mid 2000s. Frank Nora already had his *New Time Radio* moniker to describe downloadable online broadcasts. Jim Kloss famously used *Internet Magazine* at Whole Wheat Radio because he didn't think the future only belonged to Apple. A former TechTV titan preferred *netcast* because it attributed the Internet as the enabling tech, like satellite radio.

I used to think the first two terms above were more clever, fun, and relatable to a wider audience than *podcast*, but I'll admit, deep down, I thought the association with Apple's then-ubiquitous iPod was overblown in the press. Despite what Apple's legal team may have thought at the time, they didn't invent the word *pod*. And besides, everyone knew they could download and listen to Ze Frank or Digital Flotsam wherever they wanted.

But just as I did with a new bottle of Siracha Tabasco in a pasta dish, I grossly under-estimated the term's impact. Years before podcasting became as cool and ubiquitous as it is now, I still fielded questions for my own silly show asking why they needed an Apple device to listen to it. I ended up linking to the BBC's podcasting FAQ page where they took great pains to say it worked on your desktop, iRiver, flip phone, or anything else that supported MP3s.

Meanwhile in open source at the time, GitHub was taking off as the Internet's premier code repository and project collaboration platform. I still remember listening to a lecturer at uni assuring us that we didn't *need* to use GitHub if we wanted to use Git instead of Subversion for our major assignment. I thought he was joking, but even afterwards we had group members who were confused. There are still people today who think GitHub's pull request UI is an intrinsic part of Git.

Would GitHub have become as popular if it were called CodeHub? I don't think so.

Recently I noticed rsync.net among a list of vendors on a client proposal. I thought they'd just listed the website for the indispensable file sync application that we all depend upon in the industry, but it was a link to a commercial backup service using the name. I realised my mistake, but how many stakeholders without an IT background saw that page and now think that's what rsync is?

Large companies with deep pockets can defend their trademarks, but I worry when I see the name of a free or open source tool being used in one. They may have the blessing of the tool's creator&mdash;in some cases they may not have a choice&mdash;but it does introduce confusion, and the potential to assume that one endorses the other.
