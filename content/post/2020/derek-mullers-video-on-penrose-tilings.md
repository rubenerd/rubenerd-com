Mathematics was never my strong suit, but I've always *loved* geometry. My dad used to buy me those Eyewitness multimedia CD-ROMs growing up, and I'd spend hours clicking through the conic sections, the Golden Ratio, tesselating shapes, and tracing those evil Königsberg bridges. I joked to my year 12 maths teacher that I owed my entire passing grade to just the geometry unit.

So I was so happy to see Derek Muller's latest Veritasium video about [Penrose Tilings](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=48sCx-wBs34). It brought back so many great memories, and was was so beautifully produced. Please check it out if you're at all interested in this stuff, it was a real treat.

There's just something so *deeply* satistying about geometry. It's so beautiful, and still so mysterious.
