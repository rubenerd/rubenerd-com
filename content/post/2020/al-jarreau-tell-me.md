Today's [Music Monday](https://rubenerd.com/tag/music-monday/) comes from a vinyl LP Clara and I bought from a second-hand store while we were in the [Blue Mountains](https://rubenerd.com/location/blue-mountains) in late July. I haven't been able to get this absurdly-catchy tune out of my head since my quartz-locked, linear-tracking, direct-drive Technics turntable gave it a spin.

Al Jarreau's collaboration with George Benson on *[Givin' it Up](https://www.discogs.com/George-Benson-Al-Jarreau-Givin-It-Up/release/14753620)* is one of my favourite albums of all time, but I don't know as much about Al's back catalogue. I'm rectifying this!

The entire *High Crime* album is on [iTunes/Apple Music](https://music.apple.com/au/album/high-crime/276974433) and the [YouTubes](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uLEWBWOSObc&list=OLAK5uy_kZoFYUCWbdQfWhlnSvPXSRdSdInNCmieI).
