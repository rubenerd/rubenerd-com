Clara and I only recently discovered the [NHK World-Japan's AppleTV application](https://www3.nhk.or.jp/nhkworld/en/app/), but it's beyond delightful. There are hundreds of free-to-air documentaries from architecture, art, engineering, food, railway journeys, and culture. Clara and I have been doing a *lot* of vicarious travel through it lately, and it's really helped with cabin fever.

It reminded me of all those hours watching *[Japan Hour](https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/video-on-demand/japanhour)* on Channel News Asia, which I still did till recently via a VPN on my Singaporean cloud server. Not that I'd condone or admit to that. Admit to what? Exactly.
