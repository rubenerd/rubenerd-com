I was doing some MiniDisc research for Clara's and my [budget, vintage Hi-Fi setup](https://rubenerd.com/omake/hi-fi-build/). We love having physical media again, and a MiniDisc deck would complement the rest of the stack in an undoubteldly fabulous and nostalgic way.

This was the summary on a [CNET search result](https://www.cnet.com/products/sony-mds-je330-minidisc-recorder/ "Sony MDS-JE330 - MiniDisc recorder Specs - CNET") in DuckDuckGo:

> Discuss: Sony MDS-JE330 - MiniDisc recorder Sign in to comment. Be respectful, keep it civil and stay on topic. We delete comments that violate our policy, which we encourage you to read

I still hold out hope that, one day, treating people properly will be as intuitively obvious as not sleeping on a durian, or wearing a mask during a pandemic.
