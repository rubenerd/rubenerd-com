Me? Making a spelling mistake? That's *unpossible!* Here's yesterday's post about the [GoToMeeting guy](https://rubenerd.com/that-guy-in-the-gotomeeting-splash-screen/):

> The screen says “John Doe”, but I’m going to start **referring to him Jim**. Every Jim I’ve ever met has been nice.

Referring to him *as* Jim, or *to* a gym?

> The **information-desnse** screen was a staple of so many buildings in Singapore

The information-desnse? *Information-desnse-esnse-esnse* you ought to [know by now](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8buJ2-oD02E "Billy Joel: Movin' Out")! These have both been corrected, for our convenience.
