It's been [two days](https://rubenerd.com/fate-grand-order-servantfes-2020-dialogue/) since Robin Hood conversed with Jeanne Alter in the *Servant Summerâ˜…Festival 2020* of everyone's [favourite mobile game](https://fate-go.us/). I love how just a few short years ago that entire sentence would have seemed inexplicable to me, and chances are for many of you it still does. FGO is a lot of fun, equal parts visual novel and pseudo-card game.

But I digress; Jeanne Alter continues to win Clara and I over with her dialogue and over-reactions!
