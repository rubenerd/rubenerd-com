We go back to Korea for this week's [Music Monday](https://rubenerd.com/tag/). I heard this downbeat jazzy tune in one of my favourite coffee shops in [Milsons Point](https://www.openstreetmap.org/search?query=milson%27s%20point#map=16/-33.8468/151.2111) this afternoon and couldn't get it out of my head. The owners were kind enough to show me the cover, which I also love. 🇰🇷

The colour and aesthetic matches my [Sun Microsystems nostalia post](https://rubeerd.com/andranig-vartanian-on-solaris-with-more-nostalgia/) from yesterday almost too well.
