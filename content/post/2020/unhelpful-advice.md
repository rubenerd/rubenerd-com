Offering immediate suggestions for frustrating problems was among the biggest boyfriend mistakes I used to make; a phrase I never thought I’d say given I was the latest of late bloomers! Sometimes people need to vent, as Clara did when Excel crashed and AutoSave rubbished the file. I could have advised that frequent saving would minimise that happening, but that's not what someone losing an hour of work wants to hear. They want a hug, a cup of tea, and to share in shouting *fuck Excel!*

Well-meaning but oblivious advice of this nature is rampant online, and can usually be identified by that magical word *just*, or the phrase *have you considered*. The trackpad on your laptop broke? *Just* use an external USB one. Stuck at home? *Have you considered* not being depressed? Or my personal favourite from at least 2013: *[why?](https://rubenerd.com/when-people-answer-questions-with-why/)*

Here are some other forms of what [Asher Wolf called unhelpful advice](https://twitter.com/Asher_Wolf/status/1303244722299838464). The first was my suggestion:

* "It can only get better from here!"
* "It could always be worse."
* "Think of it as a growing experience."
* "You’ll get better when you're ready."
* "What doesn't kill you makes you stronger."
* "Just apply for anything."
* "Everything happens for a reason."

I refer to these specifically as *oblivious* advice, because not only do they avoid factoring in anything about the person's circumstance, they seek to outright ignore it. Even if well-meaning, they're also logically flawed, and not what people under duress want to hear. Or maybe that's just me!
