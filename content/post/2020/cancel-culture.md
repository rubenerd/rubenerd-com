Billy Bragg in [The Guardian](https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/jul/10/free-speech-young-people):

> An open letter that is clearly decrying cancel culture (without naming it as such), signed by 150 academics and writers from all sides of the political spectrum, appeared this week in Harper’s Magazine. The signatories complained of a censoriousness that was stifling debate and called for arguments to be settled by persuasion rather than action. Lip service was paid to the menace of Donald Trump, but the main thrust of their argument was a howl of anguish from a group that has suddenly found its views no longer treated with reverence.

Mary McNamara in the [Los Angeles Times](https://www.latimes.com/entertainment-arts/story/2020-07-09/cancel-culture-harpers-letter):

> Any way you look at it, the timing is… odd. I have no idea why those who wrote and signed it thought that the middle of a global pandemic and a worldwide uprising against law enforcement’s long history of racist brutality was an ideal moment to give young people a stern talking to about the moral and societal risks of cancel culture.
