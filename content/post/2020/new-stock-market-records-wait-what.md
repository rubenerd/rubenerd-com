[Reuters reported the news](https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/business/wall-street-faces-danger-signs-after-best-quarter-since--98-12886564), via Channel NewsAsia:

> The S&P 500's strongest quarterly performance since the fourth quarter of 1998 - during the dot-com boom - was driven by gains in April and May, followed by an overall flat June after Wall Street gave back gains in the second half of the month. Globally, MSCI's world equity index has rallied to within 10per cent of its February record highs.

Genuine question: has the stock market ever been so at-odds with the real world?
