As reported by Maanvi Singh, Kenya Evelyn and Martin Belam in [The Guardian yesterday](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/live/2020/aug/12/kamala-harris-joe-biden-donald-trump-vp-pick-elections-live-updates?page=with:block-5f347e928f085d9bdb7e6b9c#block-5f347e928f085d9bdb7e6b9c)\:

> Kamala Harris and Joe Biden made their first campaign appearance as running mates. Each noted that they had first connected through Biden’s late son Beau — who was a close friend of Harris. After commemorating the historic moment — Harris is the first woman of color to be nominated vice president by a major party — the Democrats vying for the White House tore down Donald Trump’s response to the coronavirus pandemic. “This is what happens when we elect a guy who just isn’t up for the job,” Harris said. “Our country ends in tatters and so does our reputation around the world.”

Her last point cannot be overstated, as I wrote about [three years ago](https://rubenerd.com/trump/). His truly wields the reverse-midas touch when it comes to foreign policy and America's standing in the world.

This is especially hard as an Americanophile; with American friends and colleagues; who loves travelling there; who watches, listens to, and reads American media; who makes a living using American technology; and who sees the country as a critically-important ally to the free world. I want to believe in America again. 🇺🇸
