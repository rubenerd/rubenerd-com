I'm sitting at one of my new favourite cafes in the world, the [Cassiopea in Katoomba](https://cassiopeia.com.au/). Like all the best finds, Clara and I stumbled upon it on our first day wandering around the Blue Mountains, and I've kept coming back since. Their roasted beans and coffee are *so good*, the staff are super friendly, and they're open from 06:00 for us early-risers.

This is not to be confused with the Cassiopeia PDA which my mum used in the 1990s. Computer hardware used to be so much more interesting.
