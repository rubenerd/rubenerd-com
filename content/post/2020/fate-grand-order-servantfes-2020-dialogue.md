The dialogue in *[Servant Summerâ˜…Festival 2020](https://fate-go.us/servant_fest/)* on everyone's favourite [mobile game](https://fate-go.us/) has been so much needed fun over the last couple of days. Jeanne Alter's expressions and comments are particularly priceless, as is Robin Hood's baiting, deadpan delivery.

She might already be one of my new unexpected favourites, and I'm normally such an arts-heavy, defensive, *Lawful Good* kind of player. Dare I grail her to a five star equivalent?

Maybe I also enjoy summer events in mobile games because it distracts me from Southern Hemisphere winter. It's been a bit warmer the last few days, but by Australian standards it's still decently chilly.
