It's my hope that admitting to these will be the first step to overcoming them. But they seem to be so ingrained I'm not sure:

* I instinctively clear and reuse open buffers or unsaved text files, rather than closing and starting new files. Do I think I'm saving paper or electrons that way? Who knows.

* I always manually empty folders before deleting them. Even the DOS I grew up with had **DELTREE**, so maybe I'm just paranoid.

* Calculating the square root of 2. Get it? Because it's an... oh shut up.

* Hungarian notation. Visual Basic habits die hard. I do love though how readable sigils make Perl code in a plain text editor.
