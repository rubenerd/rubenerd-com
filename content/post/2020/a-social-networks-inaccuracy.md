I got this message from The Facepalm Book, a social network I log into at least once a year, maybe even twice:

> Join groups to connect with people who share your interests. RECOMMENDED FOR YOU: [..] GET COLLEGE HOMEWORK HELP [..] Canberra Local Meetup Group [..] PENRITH REGION: "Buy, Sell, Swap, Free, Trade"

I haven't been in *COLLEGE* for years, I'm not a *Canberra Local*, and I don't live in the *PENRITH REGION*. You'd think this would be basic, entry level stuff they could glean even from the precious little data they have on me, and what they creepily pieced together from friends and family.

One thing that will save us from malevolence is incompetence.
