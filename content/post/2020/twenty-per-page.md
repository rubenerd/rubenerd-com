I've updated my RSS feeds and blog to show the last *twenty* posts, instead of ten. I've used ten since I started this blog in 2004, for bandwidth reasons as much as inertia. But then I realised plain text doesn't amount to all that much more, and I don't use as many inline images thesedays given I'm usually strapped for time.

I'm not sure if I'll keep this, but I'll see. Ten is still a more satisfying number, not least because I can express it on my hands. Twenty involves my toes, which are less photogenic.

Apologies for the backdated spam if you just subscribed.
