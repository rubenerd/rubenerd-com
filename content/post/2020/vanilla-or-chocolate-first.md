The [Good Mythical Morning](https://mythical.com/) gents recently asked if you'd have your vanilla or chocolate scoop on top in a two-scoop tower configuration.

Like Natalie Imbruglia, [I'm torn](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xSZBIs0gs0E). Vanilla is so obviously the greatest ice cream flavour it's an insult to our collective intelligence having me point it out. With that established as fact, I'd be compelled to save the best till last by putting it below chocolate. But the concern would be that the chocolate would melt and mix into the vanilla, so chocolate is the only pure flavour you get.

It seems to me the only rational and reasonable answer here is to have vanilla in both positions, and eschew&mdash;gesundheit&mdash;chocolate entirely. Before you feel compelled to respond, you're welcome. üç¶
