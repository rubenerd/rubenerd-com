His is the face I'll remember the most from our time working from home. He smiles at me at least three times a day, whenever a call is connecting. I wonder who he is? Did he have a good meeting?

I'm a weird enough person that even a stock photo of someone smiling helps me before I start talking to real people. It's as if he's looking at me through the glass, saying *you've got this, Ruben!* I'm [sensing a theme](https://rubenerd.com/banprestos-1994-sailor-mercury-poster/ "Banprestoâ€™s 1994 Sailor Mercury poster").

The screen says "John Doe", but I'm going to start referring to him as Jim. Every Jim I've ever met has been nice.
