I went sixteen years without this page, but it's probably necessary now that some of my posts are being shared in high-profile places.

To [paraphrase](https://twitter.com/mwlauthor/status/1307719213067448320)  technical writer Chris Sanders:

> It's my [site] and I can do what I want here.

This blog has always been a labor of love project for me. I find writing cathodic, and a practical way to remember thoughts, news, and processes. This ethos informs the rest of this page.
