This page tracks Clara's and my progress building a nostalgic home Hi-Fi system with components from the mid-1980s to the early 1990s. We both blame my dad's generosity giving us some of his old gear, and [Techmoan](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC5I2hjZYiW9gZPVkvzM8_Cw).

This is a work-in-progress!
