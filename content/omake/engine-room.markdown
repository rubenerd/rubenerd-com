<h3 id="writing">How I write posts</h3>

**[Vim editor](https://vim.org)**

: I've tried everything, and keep coming back to this legendary editor. I'm still learning new things with it even after a decade. [NERDTree](https://github.com/scrooloose/nerdtree) is still my favourite plugin.

**[Beige Topre FC660C Keyboard](https://mechanicalkeyboards.com/shop/index.php?l=product_detail&p=1323)**

: When I'm at home, everything is typed on this beautiful ten-keyless board I bought in Akihabara. Topres are the best mechanical keyswitches around, and a welcome relief from Apple's current hot garbage!

**[Kensington Orbit Trackball](https://www.kensington.com/p/products/control/trackballs/orbit-trackball-with-scroll-ring/)**

: The only trackball mouse I've found with a scroll wheel. Once you use a trackball, you never want to go back to inferior pointing devices.

**[Git for version control](https://git-scm.org/)**

: Each blog post and site asset is version controlled with git, which makes updates easier. I far prefer [Subversion](https://svnvsgit.com/), and even [Mercurial](https://www.mercurial-scm.org/) is better, but the industry has spoken.

**[Michael Franks](http://www.michaelfranks.com/)**

: I'm often writing while listening to my favourite singer/songwriter of all time. His over half a century career include albums for every mood and time of day. Incidently, I wrote all but two of his albums on Wikipedia.<p></p>

**[Coffee shops](/omake/coffee/)**

: If there's an environment more conducive to positive thought and writing, I don't want to know.


<h3 id="runs">What runs the site</h3>

**[Hugo](http://gohugo.io)**

: This is the Porsche of static site generators; it's difficult to handle at times with Go's inscrutable templating, but its the only one around that can handle 6,000+ blog posts without taking the heat death of several universes to complete.<p></p>

**[FreeBSD](https://www.freebsd.org/)**

: It's still my preferred server operating system since trying it in high school. I use cloud instances with jails to keep things secure and easy to update.<p></p>

**[nginx](https://nginx.org/)**

: The fast, simple to configure web server and reverse proxy. Thanks to the maintainers of the [nginx-devel](https://www.freshports.org/www/nginx-devel) FreeBSD port.<p></p>

**[Let's Encrypt](https://letsencrypt.org/)**

: I bought HTTPS certs in the past, but this makes the process so simple. It can also now handle subdomains with little fuss.<p></p>

**[Ansible](https://www.ansible.com/)**

: All the site configuration, package installs and updates are carried out with Ansible playbooks.<p></p>

**[Bourne shell scripts](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bourne_shell)**

: These are the glue for everything else, for podcast pages, encoding audio, scaling Retina&trade; images, uploading generated assets, and other tasks. No bashisms.<p></p>


<h3 id="historical">What used to run the site</h3>

**[Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com) (2013–15)**

: I still think Liquid is the nicest templating system I've used, but alas Jekyll simply couldn't handle all my posts. For smaller projects, I couldn't recommend it highly enough.

**[WordPress](http://wordpress.org/) (2006–13)**

: The Mac Daddy of blogging software. Movable Type had gone commercial at that stage, and
Radio UserLand looked to be in its last throes, so I followed the pack to WordPress. For all
the security issues and poorly written plugins, it served me surprisingly well for many
years.

**[RapidWeaver](http://realmacsoftware.com/rapidweaver/) (2005)**

: An intriguing and pleasant Mac application that generated static pages, but I soon ran into limitations with updating sites from different places.

**[Perl CGI scripts](http://perl.org/) (2004-05)**

: I wrote my first site engine when at my first job out of high school, before university
started. It used CGI, which was a terrible idea but not enough people went to it to spawn
too many threads, so I avoided disaster!
