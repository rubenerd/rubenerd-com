*Omake* is an oft-abused [Japanese term] used for bonus or extra content. It's where I stash lists of stuff that doesn't belong anywhere else on a weblog. Eventually I want to use a proper outliner for this.

* [Charities and non-profits](/omake/charities/) that I donate to, and you should check out
* [Engine room](/omake/engine-room/) of stuff that powers *Rubenerd*
* [Favourite coffee shops](/omake/coffee/) around the world
* [Favourite buildings](/omake/favourite-buildings) Clara and I are ticking off
* [Friend blogroll](/omake/blogroll/) of people you should be reading
* [Hi-Fi build](/omake/hi-fi-build/) progress
* [Search engines](/omake/search-engines/) all on one page
